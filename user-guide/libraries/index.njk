<h1 id="libraries">Asset Libraries</h1>
<p class="main-paragraph">Asset Libraries allow you to store elements and styles so that they can be easily reused. Libraries may include components, graphics, colors and typographies. Learn how to create and manage them to better organize the pieces of your designs and speed your workflow.</p>

<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>

<h3 id="asset-types">Asset types</h3>
<p>In Penpot you can store four type of assets: components, graphics, colors and typographies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Components:</strong> A component is an object or group of objects that can be reused multiple times across files (projects and teams in the future). Learn more at the <a href="/user-guide/components/">components section</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors:</strong> Create your color styles and use them on fills and strokes.</li>
  <li><strong>Typographies:</strong> Penpot allows you to save typography styles with a set of reusable properties. You can always unlink a typography style maintaining the properties for the text layer.</li>
  <li><strong>[Deprecated] Graphics:</strong> In Penpot versions older than 2.0, bitmap and vector images can be stored at the Graphics section. This type was deprecated in favor of components.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-assets-to-library">Add assets to libraries</h3>
<p>You can use the “+” icon to add assets. Each of the categories have their own specific adding action.</p>
<h4>Components</h4>
<p>There are two ways to add components to an assets library:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Main components are automatically stored in the local library at the moment of being created. Learn more about components at the <a href="/user-guide/components/">components section</a>.</li>
  <li>Clicking the “+” to launch import an image that will be added as a component.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Colors</h4>
<p>Click the “+” to launch the color picker and add a color to the library. Learn more about <a href="/user-guide/color/">managing color</a></p>

</figure>
<h4>Typographies</h4>
<p>All typography styles created from the text properties (at the right sidebar) are automatically stored at the library. You can also click the “+” to create a new typography style from scratch.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you select a text layer with certain properties (font family, size, line height...) and click the "+" at the Typographies section at the assets library (left sidebar), the created typography style will include the properties of the text layer.</p>

<h3 id="edit-assets">Edit assets</h3>
<p>Press left click over any asset of the library to show the options menu. Some options are available only for certain assets.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Components:</strong> Rename, duplicate, delete, group.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors:</strong> Rename, edit, delete.</li>
  <li><strong>Typographies:</strong> Rename, edit, delete.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-assets">Use Assets</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Components:</strong> Drag the component directly from the library to the viewport.</li>
  <li><strong>Colors:</strong> With a shape or a text selected click a color from the library to apply it as a fill. If you press <kbd>Alt</kbd> (or <kbd>⌥</kbd> in macOS) while clicking, the color will be applied to the stroke.</li>
  <li><strong>Typographies:</strong> With a text layer selected click a typography style from the library to apply it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organize-assets">Organize assets</h3>
<p>Learn how to better view and organize your assets:</p>

<h4>Assets list views</h4>
<p>You can switch between list and grid views.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grid view:</strong> With the thumbnails displayed is easier to visually identify the content of specific assets, specially components.</li>
  <li><strong>List view:</strong> Optimized to identify the assets by their names and view more assets at the same time.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<h4>Order assets</h4>
<p>Click the ordering button to change the alphabetical order.</p>

</figure>

<h4>Search assets</h4>
<p>Use the Search assets box to filter the assets with names that match what you write.</p>

</figure>

<h4>Filter assets</h4>
<p>You can decide whether to show all asset types or only one (components, graphics, colors or typographies).</p>

<h4>Multiselect assets</h4>

</figure>

<h4>Group assets</h4>
<p>There are two ways to create groups in a library.</p> 
<ol>
  <li><strong>With slashes (/):</strong> Select an asset and rename it as follows: "FOLDER NAME/ASSET NAME". For example, "Buttons/Alert Button".</li>
  <li><strong>With the "Group" option:</strong> Select one or more assets at the library, then right click to show the menu and then select "Group".</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<h4>Ungroup assets</h4>
<p>You can ungroup the assets the same ways you can group them, via the menu option ("Ungroup" in this case) or renaming them.</p>

<h4>Drag assets to groups</h4>
<p>One very direct way to move assets between groups at the libraries is by dragging them.</p>

<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<h3 id="file-library">File library</h3>
<p>Each file has a File Library where assets are stored. You can find File Libraries at the workspace. To access them, click the assets panel icon at the bottom of the left toolbar or press <kbd>Alt/⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd>.</p>

<h3 id="shared-libraries">Shared libraries</h3>
<p>You can turn any regular file into a Shared Library. This means that the File Library of this file will be available to other files of projects being worked on by the team.</p>
<p>To add a Shared Library from another file, launch the libraries panel, then search and select the available libraries.</p>

<p>Shared libraries will be displayed at the libraries panel. Click on the link icon at the right of the Shared Library name to go to the file where the library is and edit its contents.</p>
